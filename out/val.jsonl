A woman is on the ground looking up at him. uncanny: The rocks are stacked in an odd shape. entities: Caveman, Paleolithic, Stone_Age. caption: So that's where all the furniture went.", "target": "The cave wife is upset at the cave woman for building the pile of rocks because the rocks also acted as the furniture in their house. It's not clear why the man did this to their house; and also, because cave people don't usually have furniture, imagining their fancy, elaborate rock furniture house is funny.", "instance_id": "39f7a79a67ea74b974c31c77fb921c87", "caption_choices": "So that's where all the furniture went.", "generated_idefics": "The image shows a man standing on top of a large pile of rocks, and a small child is standing next to him. The man appears to be explaining something to the child. The joke lies in the fact that the man is referring to the pile of rocks as \"furniture,\" which is an unconventional and humorous way to describe the pile.", "generated_llama2": " The joke in this image is a play on words and a reference to a common trope in comedy. The scene depicts a caveman standing atop a pile of rocks, with a woman looking up at him. The caption, \"So that's where all the furniture went,\" is a pun that plays on the idea that the rocks are a makeshift \"furniture\" for the caveman to stand on, rather than the typical furniture that people might expect to find in a prehistoric setting. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on the typical depiction of cavemen as primitive and uncivilized, and the clever use of language to create a humorous connection between the scene and the caption."}
{"input": "scene: a field description: A bull is talking to a cow in a field. There are swords sticking out of a bull. uncanny: The bull is not dead despite being stabbed numerous times. entities: Cattle, Bull, Dagger. caption: I didn't mean your day wasn't hard, too.", "target": "Couples sometimes compare/bicker about how hard their work days were --- here, the cow and bull are a couple. The cow is pouting because the bull isn't sympathetic about the her day, but the bull's day really does seem harder because, as evidenced by the swords stabbed in its back, it was in a bullfight. It's funny not only because the animals are having a stereotypical couple conversation, but also because the cow doesn't really seem to care about the swords, which mirrors emotional disconnectedness of human couples fighting.", "instance_id": "58ae4b854c156392714ddce3b205fff2", "caption_choices": "I didn't mean your day wasn't hard, too.", "generated_idefics": "The joke in this image is the humorous depiction of two cows standing in a field, with one of them wearing a crown on its head. This is likely a reference to the concept of royalty or kingship, and the fact that the crowned cow is looking at the other cow, which is not wearing a crown, adds to the amusement.", "generated_llama2": " The joke in this image is that the bull is alive and well despite being stabbed multiple times with swords. This is an uncanny and unexpected twist, as one would expect the bull to be dead or at least seriously injured from such a gruesome attack. The caption adds to the humor by implying that the bull is taking the cow's complaints about her day into consideration, despite the fact that he is in a very precarious and bloody situation. It's a lighthearted and absurd take on the usual \"farmer's life\" trope, where animals are personified and given human-like characteristics."}

This is a reference to a falling anvil, a trope from TVs/movies, where anvils fall and hit people on the head. In this odd world, the weather reports don't talk about chances of sun/rain, they report things like a 20% chance of anvils tomorrow.", "instance_id": "165f82f46918275db2ea836277790fc8", "caption_choices": "And tomorrow there's a twenty-per-cent chance of anvils.", "generated_idefics": "This joke is a play on words, where the speaker is using the word \"announcements\" to refer to unexpected events or objects falling from the sky. The word \"announcements\" can also be read as \"annuals,\" which are publications that provide information or stories about a particular year or event. The speaker is essentially saying that there will be a lot of unexpected events or objects falling from the sky, similar to how annuals provide information about a specific year.", "generated_llama2": " The joke in this image is that the man and woman are staring out their window at a scene where rain is causing safes to crush things, which is an absurd and unrealistic scenario. The punchline, \"And tomorrow there's a twenty-per-cent chance of anvils,\" is a play on the idea that weather forecasts often include vague and exaggerated predictions of extreme weather events, like a \"twenty-per-cent chance of anvils.\" The joke is that the situation depicted in the image is so unlikely and absurd that it might as well be followed by a similarly nonsensical weather forecast."}

There is a vulture perched in front of him. uncanny: A vulture is an unusual bird to have indoors. entities: Businessperson, Vulture, Speakerphone. caption: Janice, hold all my calls. Indefinitely.", "target": "A vulture often circles over a nearly dead animal in the wild to scavenge its corpse for food. The joke here is that, the vulture has identified the man as someone about to die, and, surprisingly, he also agrees: he nonchalantly tells his secretary to hold his calls/work forever, because he's about to die. He doesn't seem to care that he's about to die, and instead focuses on his benign work obligations, which is funny.", "instance_id": "8d765c41eeff9319df30c4002c2235f3", "caption_choices": "Janice, hold all my calls. Indefinitely.", "generated_idefics": "The joke in this image is that the man is being interviewed by a bird, which is an unusual and unexpected scenario. The man is dressed in a suit and tie, and he is sitting at a desk with a typewriter, which suggests that he might be a professional or a businessman. The bird is pecking at a piece of paper, which implies that it is taking notes or evaluating the man's performance during the interview.", "generated_llama2": " The joke in this image is that a vulture, a bird typically associated with death and scavenging, is perched in front of a businessperson sitting at a table with his hand on a phone. This is an uncanny and unexpected sight, as vultures are not typically found in office settings. The caption, \"Janice, hold all my calls. Indefinitely,\" adds to the humor by implying that the businessperson is trying to avoid important calls, perhaps because he is in a difficult or precarious situation. The image and caption work together to create a humorous and absurd scenario."}
{"input": "scene: sea description: People are in a boat paddling. A huge wave with a scary face and arms tries to get them. The Statue of Liberty is in the background. uncanny: The waves have a face and arms. entities: Rowing, Immigration, Wind_wave. caption: Row v. Wave.", "target": "A play on \"Row v. Wade\", a supreme court case which established a woman's right to access abortions. Here, the wave looks like Donald Trump, a conservative politician who is attempting to overturn row v. wade so women can't legally access abortions.

So both \"Row\" and \"Wave\" have double meanings.", "instance_id": "3da979789b9e56f24fc0071a48e3debf", "caption_choices": "Row v. Wave.", "generated_idefics": "The image is a play on the legal term \"row v. wade,\" which refers to the case Row v. Wade, a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. In this image, the \"row v. wade\" sign on the boat may indicate that the passengers are arguing about whether to row against the waves or to give up and return to shore.", "generated_llama2": " The joke in this image is that the wave is depicted as a monster with a scary face and arms, trying to attack the people in the boat. The Statue of Liberty is visible in the background, which adds a layer of irony to the situation as the statue is often associated with immigration and the idea of seeking a better life. The punchline \"Row v. Wave\" implies that the people in the boat are struggling to overcome the wave, which is a metaphor for the challenges that immigrants face when trying to reach their destination. The joke is funny because it takes a serious and dangerous situation (being attacked by a monster wave) and adds a humorous twist by using a play on words."}
