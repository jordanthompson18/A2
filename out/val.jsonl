It's not clear why the man did this to their house; and also, because cave people don't usually have furniture, imagining their fancy, elaborate rock furniture house is funny.", "instance_id": "39f7a79a67ea74b974c31c77fb921c87", "caption_choices": "So that's where all the furniture went.", "generated_idefics": "The image shows a man standing on top of a large pile of rocks, and a small child is standing next to him. The man appears to be explaining something to the child. The joke lies in the fact that the man is referring to the pile of rocks as \"furniture,\" which is an unconventional and humorous way to describe the pile."}

The cow is pouting because the bull isn't sympathetic about the her day, but the bull's day really does seem harder because, as evidenced by the swords stabbed in its back, it was in a bullfight. It's funny not only because the animals are having a stereotypical couple conversation, but also because the cow doesn't really seem to care about the swords, which mirrors emotional disconnectedness of human couples fighting.", "instance_id": "58ae4b854c156392714ddce3b205fff2", "caption_choices": "I didn't mean your day wasn't hard, too.", "generated_idefics": "The joke in this image is the humorous depiction of two cows standing in a field, with one of them wearing a crown on its head. This is likely a reference to the concept of royalty or kingship, and the fact that the crowned cow is looking at the other cow, which is not wearing a crown, adds to the amusement."}

The word \"announcements\" can also be read as \"annuals,\" which are publications that provide information or stories about a particular year or event. The speaker is essentially saying that there will be a lot of unexpected events or objects falling from the sky, similar to how annuals provide information about a specific year."}

The joke here is that, the vulture has identified the man as someone about to die, and, surprisingly, he also agrees: he nonchalantly tells his secretary to hold his calls/work forever, because he's about to die. He doesn't seem to care that he's about to die, and instead focuses on his benign work obligations, which is funny.", "instance_id": "8d765c41eeff9319df30c4002c2235f3", "caption_choices": "Janice, hold all my calls.

The bird is pecking at a piece of paper, which implies that it is taking notes or evaluating the man's performance during the interview."}
